concept:
the more you have the worse it is

- food are the monsters

vampire survivor type:
    * destroy the foods, level up
    * level ups make you stronger (some kinda passive skill like aura that does damage, shoots random pellets, etc), but give you something detrimental like draining your health, lowering defence, etc, like making a deal with libra
    * the goal is to make it to the end of the stage

game mechanics:
    * player starts with 100 health and a time limit 5 mins
    * upon level they lose 10 max health with another nerf (take more damage, make enemies bigger, slower movement, enemies now shoot death pellets, etc)
    * upon max level, stay at 1hp can keep getting more nerfs
    * there will be clues to where the exit is upon killing enemies?? or item pickup
    * Finishing will require finding the exit


today:
    * vacuum
    * enemies shoot death pellets
    * make enemies lower health


Gluttony
